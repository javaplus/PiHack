# Creating Your First Circuit

To create your first circuit, we first want to understand what a circuit is.  A circuit is just path for electricity to flow.  
In a typical circuit, electricity flows from a battery or some power source through wires and into something that converts electricity to some other form of energy.

The first circuit we will build will be to power a simple light (LED).

An important part of a working circuit is to make sure the circuit is complete or closed.  That is that there is a connection from the battery or power sources positive terminal through the light and to the ground.  Electricity flows from the positve terminal to the ground and if there is a break or disconnect in the circuit then the circuit is "open" and therefore no electrcity is flowing and your light won't shine.
