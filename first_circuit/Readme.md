# Creating Your First Circuit

To create your first circuit, we first want to understand what a circuit is.  A circuit is just path for electricity to flow.  
In a typical circuit, electricity flows from a battery or some power source through wires and into something that converts electricity to some other form of energy.

The first circuit we will build will be to power a simple light (LED).
