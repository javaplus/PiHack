# PiHack

Repository for learning some electronics basics and how to code on the Raspberry Pi!


Below are the links for the hands on exercises to learn how to work with simple electronics and programming with the Raspberry Pi.
The Basic Exercises are designed to give you the foundation to which to build off of.  The Basic Exercises give you all the instructions to complete them.
Once you complete the Basics, you should have some basic understanding of how to work with the Raspberry Pi to record inputs and control LEDs.
From there, the Extensions can help you add to your project to make it more challenging and exciting!
