## Simple Button 

Now we will add a simple button to our circuit.  A button acts like a simple switch.

A switch (or a button in our case) allows a circuit to be open (no electricity flowing) or closed (electricity flowing).  
Here is a picture demonstrating a simple switch in a circuit in an open and closed position.  Or Off and On.

The button we use in our exercise will take the place of the switch but acts in the same way as a switch.  When you are not pressing the button, no electricity can flow because the circuit is "open".  
When you press the button down, it closes the circuit and allows electricity to flow.

To align the button properly in the breadboard, be sure to look at the bottom of the button and find the slot that looks like a line.  The button should be installed in the breadboad so that line or slot should be in the same direction as the rows.
So, in the diagram below the slot or line is running vertically(up and down) just like the rows.
