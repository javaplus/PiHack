## Welcome to the Lunch Line Madness Advanced Hackathon!

**Objective:** 

Our High School lunch lines are way too long! We need to figure out a way to maximize lunch time for students but we do not have any data! 

In this hackathon we will need each team to create a set of sensors that will detect the number of students that come through each lunch line and the duration that they spend in line.  We will then use the data gathered to make decisions on how to best mimize the time students spend in line and maximize lunchtime for students and teachers!  

Horray! No more waiting in long lunch lines!
