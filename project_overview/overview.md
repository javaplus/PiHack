## Welcome to the Lunch Line Madness Advanced Hackathon!

**Objective:** High School Lunch lines are way too long! We need to figure out a way to maximize lunch time for students but we do not have any data! This hackathon is designed to create lunch line sensors so that we can gather data and make decisions on how to best maximize time for students and teachers!  No more waiting in long lunch lines!
