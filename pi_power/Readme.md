## What is the Raspberry Pi

Up to this point, we've just been learning a few basics about electronics.  It's now time to start introducing the Raspberry Pi.

Raspberry Pi's are micro computers created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Raspberry Pi's were created to allow everyone to have the opportunity to work with hardware and learn programming. 

Learn more about the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/).

The specific model we will be using for our exercise is the Raspberry Pi Zero W.  This is a tiny computer not much bigger than a stick of gum that has built in wireless/Wifi capabilities.

## Unlimited POWER!!!!!!!

For this simple exercise we will just replace our current power supply by using the Raspberry Pi to provide power to our bread board.

The Raspberry Pi has 40 pins that allow you to interface with it.  Many of the pins are General Purpose Input/Output Pins (GPIO), but some also provide constant power out.

We will be using the pins that provide constant power out to connect to our bread board.  And of course, as we learned in the first lesson, to create a circuit the power has to flow from a positive terminal to the "ground"(negative).

So, simply follow the diagram below to connect your Pi to the breadboard.  Be sure to then power on your pi to see your circuit still work with power coming from the Pi.
