# Thonny
Thonny is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python.  This means Thonny combines some common tools used for Python development and places them in a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

With Thonny, users can open, edit and save Python files that are located on the Raspberry Pi.  Once those files have been opened, you can use Thonny to run the Python scripts.
